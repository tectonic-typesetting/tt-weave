\textbf{Preamble.} This digital book describes the \XeTeX\ typesetting engine,
which converts input \TeX\ source code to the XDV binary format.

\XeTeX\ is a modified version of Donald Knuth’s \TeX\ program, consisting of a
core implemented in the WEB language and extensions written in C and C++. WEB is
a literate programming language, combining code and documentation. This book
expresses both aspects. It was generated from the \XeTeX-modified WEB code using
a program called
\special{tdux:mfs a^^J%
Dtarget _blank^^J%
Dhref https://github.com/tectonic-typesetting/tt-weave/}tt-weave\special{tdux:me a},
which typesets the associated documentation and rewrites the WEB source into a
new syntax resembling the C and Rust languages. As such this book should be taken
as informative, but not definitive, regarding the workings of the \XeTeX\ program.

The original \TeX\ WEB code written by Donald Knuth is comprehensively
documented. The modified \XeTeX\ code is not always as thorough, and its
components written in C and C++ are not captured in this book at all. Nor are
the other programs and resources that \XeTeX\ needs to be combined with to
compile real-world documents.

This digital book is a product of the
\special{tdux:mfs a^^J%
Dtarget _blank^^J%
Dhref https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/}Tectonic project\special{tdux:me a},
a \TeX\ typesetting system that is based on the \XeTeX\ engine implementation.
The book was generated from the \XeTeX\ source tree maintained by the
\special{tdux:mfs a^^J%
Dtarget _blank^^J%
Dhref https://www.tug.org/texlive/}\TeX\ Live\special{tdux:me a}
project by scripts from the
\special{tdux:mfs a^^J%
Dtarget _blank^^J%
Dhref https://github.com/tectonic-typesetting/tectonic-staging/}\textsf{tectonic-staging}\special{tdux:me a}
repository. While a minimal patch is applied to the \TeX\ Live code in
order to create a WEB document that can be compiled to PDF using the
stock WEAVE program and Tectonic, no other modifications to the source are made.
Any discrepancies between this book and the original sources are the
responsibility of the Tectonic project.

WEB programs are defined as a series of numbered modules. Use the left and right
arrow keys to navigate between them.
