\textbf{Preamble.} This digital book describes the WEAVE program, which converts
a WEB program to \TeX\ code.

This book was generated using a WEAVE-like program called
\href{https://github.com/tectonic-typesetting/tt-weave/}{tt-weave}, which
rewrites the WEB source into a new syntax resembling the C and Rust languages.
As such its contents should be taken as purely informational and not as defining
the actual WEAVE program.

WEB programs are defined as a series of numbered modules. Use the left and right
arrow keys to navigate between them.
